            <p> Reflecting on our time at Stevens, we’ve found that in order to run a successful course, communication
                among
                instructors and students is paramount. The team has used several platforms for course communication at
                Stevens: Slack, Piazza, Canvas discussions, and more. While all of them have their merits, they all fall
                into some familiar problems: too clunky, outdated UI,or hard to sort through. Lighthouse is our attempt
                at
                building a solution that is easy to use and quick in getting you the answer you need.
            </p>
            <p>
                While platforms like Slack and Piazza are normally perfectly viable solutions, once the frequency of
                questions being asked increases, it becomes arduous to dig through all conversation threads and becomes
                much
                easier to simply ask a question without looking at previous threads, even if it might be a duplicate.
                What
                this ends up doing is it just adds to the sheer amount of conversation threads to sort through and makes
                it
                harder for the next person to find what they’re looking for. Thus, the cycle continues. Lighthouse aims
                to
                combat the problem of scale through auto-tagging features and identifying similar questions before
                submission and redirecting them to questions that might be able to solve their problem
